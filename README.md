# Flight Logbook Dashboard

This repository hosts a dynamic, cross-platform flight logbook and dashboard for tracking and analyzing personal flight activity, aircraft, and time.

## Features

- **Master Sheet:** Consolidated flight logs from all months
- **Dropdown Filters:** Select by month, pilot, or aircraft
- **Dynamic Dashboard:**
  - KPI summaries (total hours, flights, most used aircraft/pilot)
  - Interactive charts (hours/month, hours/type)
  - Filtered log view
- **Pivot Table Templates:** Auto-summarize by aircraft, pilot, time category, and more

## File Structure

- `2025.xlsx` – Main logbook and dashboard file
- `README.md` – Project documentation
- `.gitignore` – Prevents temp/system files from being tracked

## Usage

1. Clone the repo or open from any GitHub-enabled platform.
2. Open `2025.xlsx` in Excel or OnlyOffice (supports HSTACK/VSTACK/FILTER).
3. Use dropdowns to filter and view dashboard summaries.
4. Update logs monthly — dashboard updates automatically.

## Privacy

This is a **private repository**. Do not share or redistribute flight logs or dashboards without permission.

## TODO

- Add automated visual summaries by log category
- Integrate optional scripting for exporting summaries
- Improve mobile and tablet compatibility
